# Advent of Code 2022
My solutions to Advent of Code 2022

## Instructions

### R Solutions
- Set your working directory to be within the `advent-of-code-2022` folder
- Run `renv::restore()` in the R console. If you do not have the `renv` package then you can install it using `install.packages("renv")`
- Manually set your working directory to be in the folder of the question you want to run. This can be done easily within R Studio by first opening the R script you wish to run then going to `Session > Set Working Directory > To Source File Location`
- Then simply run the script and the solution gets printed to the console

### Python3 Solutions
- To run the solution for question `<xx>` , `cd` into the directory of `question<xx>` then run `python3 question<xx>.py`
