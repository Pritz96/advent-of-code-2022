# Advent of Code 2022
My solutions to Advent of Code 2022

## Instructions
### Python Solutions
To run a solution written in Python `cd` into the directory of the question and run `python3 question<xx>.py`

### R Solutions
To run a solution written in R, manually set your working directory to be in the folder of the question you want to run. Ensure that you also have installed the necessary packages in order to run that script, typically this will be 'dplyr'. Then simply run the script and the solution gets printed to the console.
